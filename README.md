# Book of problems

## PREFACE

I am a Computer Science teacher, currently delivering the IB Diploma Computer Science course and the CIE iGCSE Computer Science course, as well as middle school introduction to programming classes. As such I am always on the hunt for good, well structured programming problems that are suitable for beginner programmers.

While internet searches yield thousands of results, and wonderful resources such as Code Abbey exist, I am yet to find a well curated set of problems specific to my target need, something I have found surprising. To that end, I decided it was time to start curating my own set.

My general criteria for inclusion into this set:

* Accessible to adolescent beginner programmers (those who have been programming for just a few months, having completed basic skills lessons)
* Safe to assume understanding of built in data types, selection, iteration, lists/arrays, functions
* May require a scaffolded new skills to be learnt as part of the exercise (such as classes)
* Usually self-contained (ie: not dependant on other projects/exercises unless explicitly stated)
* Generally able to be completed within an hour or two outside the classroom (home learning)
* Any time there is a problem that requires a new technique, the resource to learn that technique should be identified, and as a minimum one additional problem using that technique should also exist to reinforce/practice/develop it.

The problems aren't really arranged into any pre-set order of difficulty, but some groupings of similar types of projects has been attempted.

Many (most) of these problems I have found elsewhere and adapted to better suit my adolescent beginner programmer students. Where possible I have sought to provide attribution for the origin of a problem, but some have been in my random collection of folders for far too long.

Anyway, if you are a student or a teacher of computer science, I hope you will find this collection useful.
