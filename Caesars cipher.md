# Caesars cipher

## TASK

Julius Caesar created one of the first own encryption algorithms. It used a substitution method where each letter was replaced by another a fixed number of letters across from the original.

* Upper/lower casing should be maintained
* Punctuation characters and digits should be ignored

| Example input                         | Cipher key | Example output                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| attack                             | 3             |  dwwdfm                             |
| defend the east wall of the castle |      1        |  efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf |
| captain my captain                 | 5             | hfuyfns rd hfuyfns                  |

## REMEMBER

* Your program must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data.
* Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly.
* All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.

## NEXT

Look at the Vigen√®re cipher as an extension of the Caesar cipher.
