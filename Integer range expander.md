## TASK ONE

An interval of positive integers can be succinctly described by giving its first and last value,
inclusive, separated by a minus sign. For example, the interval 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 can be described as
"5-9". Multiple intervals can be described together by separating them with commas. An interval
that contains only one value is given as just that value. Given a string that contains one or more such
comma-separated interval descriptions, guaranteed not to overlap and to be listed in sorted
ascending order, create and return a list that contains all the integers contained by these intervals.

| Example input                         | Example output                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `4-6,10-12,16` | `[4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 16]` |
| `1,3-9,12-14,9999` | `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 9999 ]` |
