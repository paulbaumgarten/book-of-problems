# Weather forecast app

## RECOMMENDED PRIOR UNDERSTANDING

If you would like to know the basics of what an API is, check out this post by iamapizza. http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qowts/eli5_what_is_api/c3z9kok

APIs that are in Json are essentially lists and dictionaries. Remember that to reference something in a list, you must refer to it by what number element it is in the list, and to reference a key in a dictionary, you must refer to it by it's name.

## RECOMMENDED PACKAGES

## RECOMMENDED RESOURCES

## TASK ONE

Create a program that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap.org that prints out information about the current weather, such as the high, the low, and the amount of rain for wherever you live. Depending on how skilled you are, you can actually do some neat stuff with this project.

## TASK TWO

Print out data for the next 5-7 days so you have a 5 day/week long forecast.

## TASK THREE

Add a GUI front end to your app
